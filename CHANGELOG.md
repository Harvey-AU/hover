# Changelog

All notable changes to the Adapt project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/)
and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

Multiple version updates may occur on the same date, each with its own version
number. Each version represents a distinct set of changes, even if released on
the same day.

## Release Automation

When merging to main, CI automatically creates releases based on the changelog:

- `## [Unreleased]` or `## [Unreleased:patch]` → Patch release (0.6.4 → 0.6.5)
- `## [Unreleased:minor]` → Minor release (0.6.4 → 0.7.0)
- `## [Unreleased:major]` → Major release (0.6.4 → 1.0.0)

On merge, CI will:

1. Calculate the new version number
2. Replace the heading with `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Add a new `## [Unreleased]` section above
4. Create a git tag and GitHub release
5. Commit the updated changelog

## [Unreleased:patch]

### Fixed

- Global sitemap insertion semaphore (`GNH_SITEMAP_CONCURRENCY`, default 3)
  limits how many jobs may insert sitemap batches concurrently; previously N
  simultaneous job creations launched N independent goroutines each writing
  100-URL UNNEST batches every 200ms, causing a combined write burst that pushed
  DB EMA well above the 60ms high-water mark and shed concurrency to the 10-slot
  floor
- Archive sweeps now permanently skip tasks where both hot storage and cold
  storage return a 404; previously the task was left with
  `html_archived_at = NULL` and re-queued on every sweep, consuming cold storage
  quota and archive-worker capacity with no chance of success

## Full changelog history

## [0.32.0] – 2026-04-11

### Added

- Adaptive DB pressure controller: EMA-based semaphore throttle that sheds
  concurrency slots when query execution time crosses a configurable high-water
  mark and restores them gradually when load eases; tunable via
  `GNH_PRESSURE_HIGH_MARK_MS` (default 60ms) and `GNH_PRESSURE_LOW_MARK_MS`
  (default 20ms)
- Four new OTEL metrics pushed to Grafana via OTLP: `bee.db.pressure.ema_ms`,
  `bee.db.pressure.limit`, `bee.db.pressure.adjustments_total`,
  `bee.db.semaphore.wait_ms`
- OTLP metrics export alongside existing Prometheus endpoint; metrics endpoint
  derived automatically from the traces endpoint (`/v1/traces` → `/v1/metrics`)

### Changed

- Sitemap task insertion now batches 100 URLs at a time (down from 1,000) with a
  configurable inter-batch delay (`GNH_SITEMAP_BATCH_DELAY_MS`, default 200ms)
  to prevent write bursts from spiking DB pressure on large sitemaps
- Jobs with sitemaps now transition to `running` after the first batch of tasks
  is inserted rather than waiting for the full sitemap crawl to complete;
  homepage (`/`) is hoisted to the front of the URL list to ensure it is in the
  first batch and scored with priority 1.0
- Pressure controller initial concurrency limit lowered from 55 → 30 to start
  conservatively after a restart

## [0.31.14] – 2026-04-09

### Performance

- Drop 6 redundant indexes on the `tasks` table (`idx_tasks_job_id_status`,
  `idx_tasks_job_host`, `idx_tasks_job_id`,
  `idx_tasks_job_status_priority_pending`, `idx_tasks_pending_by_job_priority`,
  `idx_tasks_pending_claim_order`); removing `idx_tasks_job_id_status`
  re-enables PostgreSQL HOT for status-only updates, eliminating full index
  maintenance across all 17 indexes on every task transition; retains
  `idx_tasks_running_started_at` which is used by stuck-task detection queries

### Internal

- Upgrade OpenTelemetry SDK to v1.43.0
- Pin Prettier to package.json version in auto-release workflow via `npm ci`

## [0.31.13] – 2026-04-09

### Performance

- Replace 3× correlated `COUNT(*) WHERE status = '…'` subqueries in
  `update_job_counters` UPDATE path with O(1) incremental deltas computed from
  `OLD`/`NEW.status`; add an early-exit guard that skips the `UPDATE jobs`
  entirely for non-terminal, non-starting transitions (e.g. pending↔running),
  which previously triggered all three full-table scans for no counter change
- Drop `trigger_update_job_progress` (the legacy full-scan trigger that was
  never removed when `update_job_counters` was added); both triggers fired on
  every task status change causing 2× jobs row UPDATEs and 3× COUNT(\*) scans
  per concurrent worker — the primary cause of sustained 100% Supabase CPU
- Extend `update_job_counters` to handle job status transition (`running` →
  `completed`) with the same O(1) incremental logic, preserving `cancelled` and
  `failed` terminal states
- Narrow `trg_update_job_queue_counters` from `AFTER UPDATE` (all columns) to
  `AFTER UPDATE OF status` — eliminates function-call overhead on metadata-only
  task updates (response_time, priority_score, etc.)
- Replace one-at-a-time waiting-task promotion loop in
  `promoteWaitingTasksWithQuota` with a single batch call to
  `promote_waiting_tasks_for_job`, reducing N DB round-trips to 1 per job and
  computing quota/concurrency limits upfront via a LATERAL subquery

## [0.31.12] – 2026-04-09

### Performance

- Add three partial/covering indexes on `tasks` to reduce Supabase CPU load
  under high concurrency: `idx_tasks_job_has_html_storage` and
  `idx_tasks_job_html_archived` eliminate heap scans in `MarkFullyArchivedJobs`
  EXISTS/NOT EXISTS subqueries; `idx_tasks_job_activity_times` covers the
  per-job MAX timestamp scan in `CleanupStuckJobs`
- Move traffic score UPDATE in `EnqueueURLs` to a separate transaction after the
  job-row lock is released, reducing lock hold time for concurrent workers on
  the same job
- Skip traffic score updates for link-discovered pages deeper than ~3 hops from
  the homepage (priority < 0.729) — these pages are too numerous for the
  `page_analytics` join to be worthwhile; sitemap sources always apply
- Merge two row-level INSERT triggers (`update_job_counters`,
  `update_job_queue_counters`) into a single statement-level trigger; a 500-row
  batch now emits one `UPDATE jobs` instead of 1,000, eliminating the dominant
  source of lock contention during `EnqueueURLs`
- Replace correlated `COUNT(*) WHERE status != 'skipped'` subquery in
  `EnqueueURLs` with `total_tasks - skipped_tasks` (now maintained incrementally
  by the statement-level trigger), removing a per-call table scan from inside
  the job-row lock
- Fix `promote_waiting_task_for_job` to promote N tasks per slot release instead
  of always 1; replace the stale `running_tasks` capacity join with a
  caller-supplied count; remove the redundant promotion loop from the batch
  flush transaction (ran under stale data and caused lock contention inside an
  already long-held lock)

## [0.31.11] – 2026-04-09

### Fixed

- Deduplicate `www.` and non-www URLs to the same page record, preventing
  duplicate tasks for the same path (#303)

## [0.31.10] – 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- Workers no longer block for up to 60 s on domain rate-limit delays;
  `TryAcquire` returns immediately when a domain's delay window is active,
  allowing the worker to pick up a task for a different domain instead
- Domain-delayed tasks are now correctly requeued as `waiting`: the DB
  `running_tasks` slot is released via `releaseRunningTaskSlot` (previously
  missing, causing `running_tasks` to stay at the concurrency cap and
  permanently blocking task promotion), the task status is persisted via
  `QueueTaskUpdate`, and the in-memory concurrency counter is decremented

## [0.31.9] – 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- Prevent deadlocks on concurrent batch page upserts by sorting rows by
  `(host, path)` in Go before building `UNNEST` arrays, ensuring all
  transactions acquire locks in a consistent order
- Sort enqueued pages by ID before insert to prevent lock-order deadlocks in
  `EnqueueURLs` transactions
- Demote permanent HTTP 4xx/429 task failures from warn/info to debug to reduce
  log noise at the default info level

### Changed

- Raise review app VM to 1 GB / 2 vCPU and align `DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS` to 40 to
  match Supabase preview branch pool size
- Increase production `DB_QUEUE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` to 55 to better utilise
  available connections
- CI now automatically sets Supabase preview branch pool size to 40 on each
  review app deployment

## [0.31.8] – 2026-04-07

### Changed

- Cap dynamic worker max scale from 50 to 40 to stay within DB pool budget
- Raise `DB_MAX_OPEN_CONNS` from 45 to 50 (pgBouncer ceiling is 90)
- Lower `DB_QUEUE_MAX_CONCURRENCY` from 40 to 30, leaving 16 connections for
  non-queue direct calls
- Add `GNH_BATCH_CHANNEL_SIZE=5000` to absorb peak batch write bursts (was 2,000
  default)

## [0.31.7] – 2026-04-06

### Added

- Cold storage archival system — completed task HTML automatically moves from
  Supabase hot storage to R2 (or S3/B2) via a background sweep, keeping storage
  within quota without losing data
- `archived` job status — jobs are marked archived once all their task HTML has
  been moved to cold storage; the UI renders this as a success state, not an
  error
- Archive startup connectivity check — logs a clear error on boot if the cold
  storage bucket is unreachable before the first sweep runs
- `cmd/archive_key_migrate` one-shot tool to rekey existing archived objects
  from the old path format to the canonical
  `jobs/<id>/tasks/<id>/page-content.html.gz` layout

### Security

- Set TLS 1.2 minimum on AIA cert-inspection transport to prevent protocol
  downgrade during handshake
- Route all AIA HTTP requests through `ssrfSafeDialContext` — IP check at
  connect time (not just URL-parse time) to prevent DNS rebinding
- Add `CheckRedirect` to AIA and cert-inspection clients to re-validate redirect
  targets against scheme and private-host checks, preventing SSRF via redirect
- Bound `isPrivateHost` DNS lookup with a 2 s context; fail-closed on timeout
- AIA intermediate certs stored in a separate slice — never injected into
  `TLSClientConfig.RootCAs`; chain verified via `VerifyConnection` callback
- Guard AIA intermediate acceptance: reject self-signed certs and certs without
  `IsCA + BasicConstraintsValid`
- Sanitise AIA log calls to record `host` only, not the full raw URL
- Replace credential-like literals in DSN test fixtures with neutral
  placeholders; remove associated `nolint:gosec` annotations

### Fixed

- Archive default interval corrected to 1 minute (was 1 hour in code default,
  conflicting with fly.toml override)
- Sweep shutdown now propagates a sweep-scoped cancel to all in-flight archive
  goroutines — stop signal no longer leaves goroutines running detached
- Job card renders `archived` status with success styling instead of falling
  through to the error branch
- Archive CAS update now checks `RowsAffected` before deleting the old object —
  prevents orphan deletion if another process already migrated the key
- R2 upload: use unsigned payload and explicit `Content-Length` header; disable
  auto-checksum trailer to avoid SDK/R2 compatibility issues
- Fix doubled path segment in cold storage object key
- Fix archive bucket name mismatch between config and fly secrets
- Fix content type fallback so archived HTML is always stored as
  `text/html; charset=utf-8` + `gzip` encoding

## [0.31.6] – 2026-04-06

### Added

- `hover jobs generate --repeats N` flag to run each test domain N times,
  cycling through domains as their previous jobs reach a terminal status
- `hover jobs generate --limit N` flag to cap total jobs submitted regardless of
  domain count × repeats
- Per-domain stall backoff: after 3 consecutive status-refresh failures the job
  is placed in a timed backoff (5× `--status-interval`) before the domain is
  allowed to restart, preventing duplicate jobs while still recovering from
  transient API errors
- Per-domain create-retry cap: after 3 consecutive `createJob` failures the run
  slot is marked skipped so the load test loop can always terminate
- `"paused"` treated as a terminal job status so paused jobs do not block
  subsequent repeats

### Fixed

- `createJob` now returns a real error when the response cannot be parsed or
  contains no job ID, rather than recording a fake `"unknown"` ID
- HTTP error responses from `createJob` and `fetchJobStatus` no longer include
  the raw response body; errors now report the HTTP status code and optional
  `X-Request-Id` header value only
- Skipped run slots (create-retry cap reached) no longer increment
  `jobsCreated`; the summary accurately reflects only successfully submitted
  jobs

## [0.31.5] – 2026-04-06

### Security

- Fix P-256 JWKS coordinate encoding in tests — replaced `big.Int.Bytes()`
  (drops leading zeros) with `ecdh.PublicKey.Bytes()` to produce RFC 7518
  §6.2.1.2-compliant fixed-length coordinates
- Harden AIA fetching in `tls_aia.go` against DNS rebinding by routing all AIA
  HTTP requests through `ssrfSafeDialContext()` (IP check at connect time, not
  just URL-parse time)
- Add `CheckRedirect` to AIA and cert-inspection clients to re-validate redirect
  targets against scheme and `isPrivateHost` checks, preventing SSRF via
  redirect
- Replace unbounded `net.LookupHost` in `isPrivateHost` with a 2 s
  context-bounded `net.DefaultResolver.LookupIPAddr`; fail-closed on timeout
- Deduplicate private-IP predicate in `isPrivateHost` — now delegates to shared
  `isPrivateOrLocalIP` from `crawler.go`
- Set `MinVersion: tls.VersionTLS12` on AIA cert-inspection transport to prevent
  protocol downgrade during handshake
- Add `ssrfSafeDialContext` and `CheckRedirect` guard to cert-inspection client
  (`inspectClient`) so the HEAD request used to read the leaf cert is also
  protected against DNS rebinding and open redirects
- Replace credential-like literals (`user:pass`, `password=pass`) in DSN test
  fixtures with neutral placeholders; remove `nolint:gosec` annotations
- Refactor AIA intermediate handling: fetched certs are now stored in a separate
  `intermediates []*x509.Certificate` slice and never injected into
  `TLSClientConfig.RootCAs`; the retry uses a `VerifyConnection` callback that
  verifies the chain against system roots + fetched intermediates via
  `x509.VerifyOptions`
- Guard AIA intermediate acceptance with `IsCA + BasicConstraintsValid` and
  self-signed checks so root CAs served from AIA URLs are rejected
- Sanitise AIA log calls to log `host` only, not the full raw URL

## [0.31.4] – 2026-04-05

### Fixed

- Fix file descriptor exhaustion under load caused by per-request HTTP transport
  leak in `CheckCacheStatus()` — each probe call created a new `http.Transport`
  that held idle connections open indefinitely, exhausting 10240 fds during
  sustained crawling
- Add shared `probeClient` to `Crawler` struct, reused across all cache probe
  requests with proper idle connection limits
- Add global `MaxIdleConns` cap (150) to main crawler and `CreateHTTPClient`
  transports to prevent unbounded idle socket accumulation across hosts
- Reduce production DB pool from 70 → 45 open connections via env vars to match
  actual queue semaphore usage (40 concurrent ops + 5 reserved)
- Add file descriptor pressure detection in `ensurePoolCapacity` — rejects DB
  operations early with `ErrPoolSaturated` (triggering existing retry/backoff)
  when fd usage exceeds 90%, instead of failing with cryptic DNS errors
- Raise container fd soft limit to hard limit ceiling in Dockerfile as safety
  net

### Added

- File descriptor observability gauges (`bee.process.fd.current`,
  `bee.process.fd.limit`, `bee.process.fd.pressure`) for Grafana monitoring

## [0.31.3] – 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- npm install downloads from correct `cli-v*` release tag

## [0.31.2] – 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- CLI release now publishes under `cli-v*` tag to avoid collision with app
  releases
- CLI release triggers independently of changelog (on CLI file changes)
- Cancellable confirmation prompt via Ctrl+C
- Sanitised error output in org switching (no raw HTTP body)

## [0.31.1] – 2026-04-04

### Added

- CLI version injected at build time (replaces hardcoded `v0.1.0`)
- CLI update check on startup — notifies when a newer version is available
- Identity and org display before job generation (`Logged in as X in Y`)
- Org switching prompt in CLI (`C` to change active organisation)
- CLI version included in PR release preview comment

### Fixed

- npm `install.js` downloads from `cli-v*` tags instead of `v*`
- Auto-release CLI change detection now includes `npm/` directory
- Release preview comment no longer picks up `cli-v*` tags as app version
- Prevent tag collision in CLI release workflow when `v*` tag already exists
- Binary existence validated after npm postinstall extraction

## [0.31.1] – 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- CLI now targets production domain (`hover.app.goodnative.co`) by default
  instead of `hover.fly.dev`
- CLI release workflow is idempotent — safe to retrigger after partial failures
- Published `@harvey-au/hover` npm package with MIT licence

## [0.31.0] – 2026-04-03

### Added

- Native `hover` CLI binary — run `hover jobs generate --pr <N>` to create
  load-test jobs without scripts or manual API calls
- Browser-based CLI authentication via the app's existing auth flow — no
  separate credentials or login page needed
- Auto-discovery of Supabase auth config from preview app, so `--anon-key` is no
  longer required
- Session persistence and token refresh for CLI — authenticate once, reuse
  across sessions
- npm distribution (`npm install -g @harvey-au/hover`) with automatic binary
  download for macOS, Linux, and Windows
- Independent CLI versioning — npm releases only trigger when `cmd/hover/`
  changes, with their own version counter
- Windows support for CLI (amd64 and arm64)

### Removed

- Hosted `cli-login.html` auth page and Python auth helper scripts — replaced by
  native browser auth flow

### Fixed

- PKCE verifier slice bounds panic when code verifier was shorter than 128
  characters

## [0.30.3] – 2026-04-03

### Fixed

- Sitemap parser now uses Go's `encoding/xml` decoder instead of string
  matching, fixing sitemaps that use CDATA wrappers (e.g. WordPress All in One
  SEO) or XML entity-encoded URLs (`&amp;` in query strings)
- AIA (Authority Information Access) transport fetches missing intermediate
  certificates at runtime, fixing TLS failures on servers with incomplete
  certificate chains (e.g. acsi.org.au)
- Job lifecycle hardened: `initialising` state prevents premature completion
  before sitemap URLs are enqueued, with stale timeout and cancellation support

## [0.30.2] – 2026-03-28

### Added

- `/dev/auto-login` endpoint — signs in as `dev@example.com` server-side and
  injects a valid Supabase session into `localStorage`, then redirects to
  `/dashboard`; returns 404 outside `APP_ENV=development`
- `dev@example.com` seed user (email/password) added to `supabase/seed.sql` for
  use with the auto-login endpoint
- `dev.sh` now auto-generates `.env.local` from `supabase status` on first run
- `.claude/launch.json` configured to start Air (hot reloading) via Claude Code
  preview — no manual server start needed
- `/preview` Claude command added to standardise preview startup and auth
- `scripts/pr-review-summary.sh` added to collect CodeRabbit comments and CI
  check results into `.claude/pr-review.md` for agent use
- Claude agent files updated to include Serena MCP tools for Go code navigation

### Fixed

- Homepage auth modal: `await loadAuthModal()` before `showAuthModal()` to
  prevent a race condition on first open
- `dev.sh` key extraction corrected to use `PUBLISHABLE_KEY` from
  `supabase status` (not `ANON_KEY`)
- `.air.toml` Mac/Linux build command now active by default; Windows override
  documented

### Changed

- Commit message convention updated across docs to plain English (5–6 words, no
  conventional commit prefixes)
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` local auth section added with seed user table and login
  instructions for both real and sandboxed browsers
- `DEVELOPMENT.md` Claude Code preview section added
- `flight-recorder.md` corrected to use port 8847 and `./cmd/app` run path
- `CLAUDE.md` updated with Serena code navigation preference and preview server
  rule
- `.claude/settings.local.json` permission allowlist tightened — removed broad
  wildcards, scoped `gh`/`git`/`supabase`/`docker` commands

## [0.30.1] – 2026-03-26

### Fixed

- Trigger redeploy to Fly with correct `fly.toml` config

## [0.30.0] – 2026-03-26

Rebranded from Adapt to Hover across the entire codebase, configuration, and
infrastructure.

### Changed

- **Brand rename** — all user-facing text, HTML titles, nav, and page headings
  updated from "Adapt" to "Hover"
- **Crawler user-agent** — `AdaptBot/1.0` → `HoverBot/1.0`
- **OpenTelemetry service identity** — service name, tracer names, and meter
  names now use `hover/*`
- **Fly.io app name** — `fly.toml` and review app config target the `hover` app
- **GitHub URLs** — badges, workflow refs, and repository links point to
  `Harvey-AU/hover`
- **Go module** — `go.mod` module path updated
- **Auth redirects** — `APP_URL` and OAuth callback references use
  `hover.app.goodnative.co`
- **Scripts and CI** — cleanup scripts, review-app workflows, and shell helpers
  reference the renamed app
- **Documentation** — all docs, plans, research summaries, and README updated

## [0.29.0] – 2026-03-25

Migrated the Hover frontend from legacy global scripts to ES modules and
established a shared codebase between the dashboard and Webflow Designer
extension. Both surfaces now consume the same logic (`app/lib/`) and components
(`app/components/`), with a bridge pattern enabling the non-module extension
runtime to access shared code.

### Added

- **Shared module architecture** (`web/static/app/`): three-layer structure —
  `lib/` (pure logic, zero DOM assumptions), `components/` (Web Components),
  `pages/` (thin per-page orchestrators)
  - Lib modules: `api-client`, `auth-session`, `config`, `formatters`,
    `integration-http`, `domain-search`, `invite-flow`, `admin`, `global-nav`
  - Web Components: `hover-job-card`, `hover-data-table`, `hover-status-pill`,
    `hover-tabs`, `hover-toast`
  - Design tokens: `tokens.css`, `base.css`, `components.css`
- **Dashboard fully on ES modules**: `dashboard.html`, `settings.html`, and job
  details run without legacy script dependencies. Settings split into focused
  modules (`lib/settings/` — account, team, plans, schedules, integrations,
  organisations)
- **Extension bridge pattern**: `lib/bridge.js` exposes `window.HoverLib`
  (`api`, `fmt`, `http`) and `window.HoverJobCard` for the extension.
  `api-client.js` made configurable with `configure({ baseUrl, tokenProvider })`
  for cross-origin use. `scripts/sync-shared.js` copies shared modules into the
  extension at build time; import map remaps `/app/` paths to local copies
- **Developer tooling**: Husky + lint-staged pre-commit hook enforces Prettier
  formatting; favicon served on all HTML pages

### Changed

- CI workflows run on PRs targeting any branch, not just `main`
- `/app/**` static routes served with `Cache-Control: public, max-age=86400`
- Synced extension components gitignored (generated by `sync-shared.js`)

### Fixed

- Global nav notification badge race condition (guarded with `BB_APP.coreReady`)
- Extension job cards rendering as plain status text (missing bridge export)
- Job details init crash when `bb-bootstrap.js` not loaded
- Seed idempotency: `auth.identities` `ON CONFLICT` column corrected

## [0.28.1] – 2026-03-22

### Security

- **Function search_path pinning**: Set `search_path = public` on 29 database
  functions missing it, closing a theoretical schema-hijacking vector. Includes
  all `SECURITY DEFINER` functions handling tokens and auth.
- **RLS on `domain_hosts`**: Enabled row-level security with deny-all default.
  Table is backend-only (service role), so no policies needed.

### Changed

- **RLS initplan optimisation**: Wrapped bare `auth.uid()` and `auth.role()`
  calls in `(SELECT ...)` across 8 RLS policies on `jobs`, `slack_user_links`,
  `notifications`, `domains`, and `pages` — evaluated once per query instead of
  per row.
- **Consolidated duplicate permissive policies**: Merged overlapping SELECT
  policies on `jobs` (org-scoped + direct ownership into one) and
  `organisation_members` (dropped redundant self-membership policy already
  covered by co-members policy). Split `jobs` FOR ALL into per-operation
  policies to avoid lint overlap.
- **Index on `jobs.status`**: Added btree index per Supabase index advisor
  recommendation, improving quota-blocked jobs query performance.

## [0.28.0] – 2026-03-22

### Added

- **Task page HTML storage**: Crawled page HTML is now captured,
  gzip-compressed, and uploaded to Supabase Storage (`task-html` bucket) with
  full metadata tracked on the task row — content type, encoding, original and
  compressed sizes, SHA-256 digest, and capture timestamp.
- **Supabase preview branch keys in CI**: Review app deploys now extract
  `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`, and `SUPABASE_URL`
  directly from the Supabase preview branch, eliminating the need for manual Fly
  secret overrides.

### Changed

- **Storage bucket consolidation**: Removed the unused `page-crawls` bucket and
  its upload code. All page HTML storage now uses the `task-html` bucket with
  proper compression and metadata tracking.
- **Bucket upsert on migration**: The `task-html` bucket INSERT now uses
  `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE SET` to enforce intended settings (privacy, size limit,
  allowed MIME types) on existing buckets.

### Fixed

- **Storage auth for preview branches**: Preview app deploys previously used the
  main project's service role key, causing `Invalid Compact JWS` and RLS errors
  when the preview branch had its own keys.
- **HTML persistence drain loop**: Removed busy-wait `default` case from the
  shutdown drain select, preventing CPU spinning when pending items are being
  processed by other workers.

## [0.27.3] – 2026-03-21

### Added

- **Per-request crawl diagnostics**: Tasks now persist a structured
  `request_diagnostics` JSONB payload covering primary requests, cache probe
  attempts, and secondary requests for later inspection without storing page
  bodies.

### Changed

- **Diagnostics hygiene**: Stored crawl diagnostics now redact sensitive
  headers, scrub query strings and fragments from recorded URLs, avoid
  duplicating full probe payloads, and preserve retry/waiting-state diagnostics
  safely through batch promotion paths.

### Fixed

- **Supabase preview seed compatibility**: `auth.identities` seed inserts now
  use the current conflict key `(provider_id, provider)`, restoring preview
  branch seeding on fresh initialisation.

## [0.27.2] – 2026-03-15

### Changed

- **Nav HTML moved to partial**: `bb-global-nav.js` now fetches
  `/web/partials/global-nav.html` at runtime instead of embedding the nav markup
  as an inline string — `global-nav.html` is the single source of truth
- **Binding convention gaps resolved**: Removed duplicate quota and notification
  logic from `dashboard.html` (canonical in `bb-global-nav.js`); create-org
  modal now uses `bbb-form="create-organisation"`; `bbb-show` on top-level
  elements in `job-details.html` replaced with explicit `style="display:none"`
  controlled by `job-page.js`; `settings.html` now loads `bb-bootstrap.js`
- **Avatar/email selectors scoped**: `auth.js updateUserInfo()` uses
  `.global-nav`-scoped `querySelector` instead of global `getElementById`

### Fixed

- **Org switcher after create**: Creating a new organisation now re-renders the
  full org list in the switcher so the new org appears immediately
- **Duplicate org names**: Creating an organisation with a name that already
  exists in the user's orgs now returns a 400 error
- **Seed idempotency**: All seed inserts use `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`;
  `auth.identities` uses correct composite key `(provider, id)`

### Security

- **Seed PII removed**: Real email addresses and provider IDs replaced with
  synthetic fixtures (`seed-admin@example.com`, `seed-member@example.com`)

## [0.27.1] – 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Postman-ready OpenAPI spec**: Added `docs/api/openapi.yaml` covering the
  current API surface for backend testing and exploration, including auth,
  request bodies, core response shapes, and documented corrections where live
  handlers differ from requested route assumptions.

## [0.27.0] – 2026-02-23

### Added

- **Webflow Designer extension auth flow**: Added dedicated popup auth handoff
  path and message contract for returning Supabase session tokens to the
  extension after sign-in.
- **Review app environment wiring**: Added `WEBFLOW_REDIRECT_URI` handling and
  updated preview app workflow config so webflow OAuth callback URLs are wired
  in CI/deploy flows.
- **UI/extension config updates**: Extended local extension manifest/build
  artifacts and widget UI styling/assets for the Webflow Designer embed.
- **Jobs list stats include**: Added optional `include=stats` support on
  `GET /v1/jobs` so extension/dashboard list views can consume job stats without
  per-job detail fetches.
- **Result chart interactions**: Added clickable past-results chart bars in the
  Webflow Designer extension that open each job's detailed results page.

### Changed

- **Webflow publish behavior**: Switched run-on-publish enabling to occur only
  when a Webflow site connection is completed; removed auto-enable behavior on
  first scan/load.
- **Auth page resilience**: Made extension auth modal load failures non-blocking
  so the app remains usable even when auth assets are delayed.
- **Auth handoff validation**: Hardened popup origin checks and request handling
  to avoid false failures in cross-origin postMessage exchange.
- **Extension results layout**: Reworked completed-run cards into grouped
  "Latest report" and "Past results" sections, default collapsed card details,
  and improved status/date placement for faster scanning.
- **Past-results chart presentation**: Updated chart to show the last 12
  completed runs with stacked OK/Error outlined bars, numeric Y-axis ticks, and
  native hover tooltips.
- **Latest report behaviour**: Changed latest result cards to start collapsed by
  default, matching past result cards.
- **Result table interactions**: Expanded result cards now auto-open the first
  available issue tab (for example, broken links) when details are opened.
- **In-progress card spacing**: Hidden empty issue and action rows while no
  issue pills are available to prevent extra blank space during active runs.

### Fixed

- **Extension popup/auth reliability**: Fixed token handoff edge cases where
  sign-in returns were dropped or malformed due to load timing and origin
  mismatches.
- **Webflow connection payload handling**: Corrected payload structure used for
  Webflow connect requests and added fallback behavior when a workspace is not
  explicitly selected.
- **Config consistency**: Added environment key examples and backend override
  support for custom Supabase auth endpoint use.
- **Extension export correctness**: Fixed extension export to build CSV from the
  API export payload (`columns` + `tasks`) instead of downloading raw JSON as a
  CSV file.
- **Issue details accuracy**: Replaced placeholder issue rows in extension tabs
  with real `/v1/jobs/:id/tasks` data, including correct broken/slow filtering,
  path-only display, and clickable links that open full URLs in a new window.
- **Live results refresh stability**: Fixed excessive re-renders/flicker by only
  re-rendering completed results and chart sections when relevant job signatures
  change.
- **Completed run transition**: Fixed state transitions so newly completed runs
  appear in Latest/Past results immediately when the in-progress card is hidden.

## [0.26.6] – 2026-02-14

### Fixed

- **Batch Page Upsert Robustness**: Page record creation now binds bulk text
  array parameters correctly and deduplicates duplicate paths within a chunk
  before upsert, preventing PostgreSQL batch upsert conflicts while preserving
  `RETURNING` IDs for both new and existing rows.

## [0.26.5] – 2026-02-13

### Fixed

- **Discovered Link Timeout Noise**: Hardened discovered-link persistence to use
  a bounded detached context and skip writes when task deadline budget is too
  low, reducing intermittent `context deadline exceeded` spikes in
  `BLUE-BANDED-BEE-86`.
- **Skip Log Context**: Added `job_id` and `domain` structured fields to new
  discovered-link skip logs for easier job-level traceability.

## [0.26.4] – 2026-02-11

### Changed

- **Go 1.26 Toolchain Upgrade**: Upgraded runtime and build tooling to Go 1.26.0
  across `go.mod`, Docker builder image, and GitHub Actions workflows to keep
  local, CI, and deploy environments aligned.
- **Go Modernisation Pass**: Applied Go 1.26 modernisers (`go fix`) in queue and
  worker hot paths, simplifying clamp/loop patterns while preserving existing
  behaviour.
- **Google API Response Typing**: Replaced remaining `map[string]any` success
  payloads in Google integration handlers/tests with typed response structs for
  stronger type intent and safer assertions.

### Fixed

- **Notification Listener Resilience**: Added panic recovery around the
  background notification listener goroutine to prevent a single panic from
  taking down the process.
- **CI Lint Compatibility**: Upgraded `golangci-lint` in CI to `v2.9.0` so lint
  runs correctly against Go 1.26 targets.

## [0.26.3] – 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **Invite Existing Users**: Inviting a user who already has a Supabase account
  no longer returns a 500 error. The system detects the existing account and
  sends a magic link email instead, with the invite record still created for
  tracking.
- **Invite List Refresh**: Pending invites list now refreshes immediately after
  sending or revoking an invite (fixed missing `await` calls).

### Added

- **Copy Invite Link**: Pending invites now show a "Copy link" button so admins
  can manually share the invite URL via other channels. Button is hidden when no
  link is available.
- **Email Delivery Status**: Invite API response now includes an
  `email_delivery` field. The UI shows a warning toast when the notification
  email could not be delivered, advising the admin to share the invite link
  manually.
- **Warning Toast Style**: Settings toast notifications support a new warning
  colour scheme (amber) for non-critical alerts.

### Changed

- **Supabase Auth Helpers**: Extracted shared `resolveSupabaseAuthURL` and
  `supabaseServiceKey` helpers to reduce duplication across invite and magic
  link flows.
- **Magic Link Security**: Magic link endpoint now uses the publishable/anon key
  rather than the service role key, following Supabase best practices.
- **Error Body Reads**: Auth error response reads are now capped at 4 KB via
  `io.LimitReader` to prevent unbounded memory allocation.

## [0.26.2] – 2026-02-07

### Added

- **Loops.so Email Client**: Custom Go client for Loops.so transactional email
  API (`internal/loops/client.go`)
  - SendTransactional, SendEvent, CreateContact, UpdateContact methods
  - Structured APIError type with status code and message
  - Idempotency key support for safe retries
  - Zero external dependencies — follows existing storage client pattern
  - Full test suite with httptest server and custom RoundTripper
- **Request Metadata Utility**: Reusable request metadata extraction
  (`internal/util/request.go`)
  - Extracts client IP (X-Forwarded-For, X-Real-IP, RemoteAddr fallback)
  - User agent parsing for browser and OS detection
  - Cloudflare geolocation via managed transform headers (cf-ipcity, cf-region,
    cf-ipcountry, cf-timezone)
  - ISO country code to full name lookup (60+ countries)
  - Smart location formatting with deduplication (e.g. "Singapore" not
    "Singapore, Singapore, Singapore")
  - 27+ table-driven tests covering all extraction and parsing functions
- **Invite Email Enrichment**: Organisation invite emails now include inviter
  name, device info, location, IP address, and timestamp
  - Inviter name extracted from Supabase JWT UserMetadata with email fallback

### Changed

- **Client IP Extraction**: Moved `getClientIP` from `internal/api/jobs.go` to
  shared `util.GetClientIP` in `internal/util/request.go` — jobs handler updated
  to use the shared function

## [0.26.1] – 2026-02-07

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Cold-Load Race Condition**: Fixed "Failed to initialise dashboard"
  error appearing on first page load (cold browser cache) across all authed
  pages
  - Root cause: `DOMContentLoaded` fired before deferred `core.js` had executed,
    so `window.BB_APP.coreReady` didn't exist yet and the await was silently
    skipped
  - New `bb-bootstrap.js` provides `BB_APP.whenReady()` — a polling wrapper that
    waits for `core.js` to finish before proceeding
  - Loaded without `defer` so it's available immediately; all pages now use a
    single `await window.BB_APP.whenReady()` call
  - Homepage now shows a visible error banner on timeout instead of silently
    leaving buttons non-functional
- **Static Asset Rate Limiting**: Hard refresh no longer triggers 429 errors on
  JS, CSS, and image files
  - Rate limiter now excludes `/js/*`, `/styles/*`, `/web/*`, `/images/*`,
    `/config.js`, and `/favicon.ico` from per-IP rate limits
  - Static assets are cheap to serve and browsers legitimately request many in
    parallel during hard refresh

## [0.26.0] – 2026-02-06

### Added

- **Settings Page**: New unified settings page with account management
  - Profile section with read-only name/email display
  - Security section with password reset via Supabase
  - Team members list with admin-gated removal
  - Team invites with send/list/revoke functionality (admin-only)
  - Plan management with current plan, change plan, and usage history

  - Dropdown to switch between organisations
  - Persistent active org selection via localStorage
  - `bb:org-switched` event for cross-component coordination
- **Global Quota Display**: Usage quota now visible in nav on all pages
  - Auto-refreshes every 30 seconds when page visible
  - Updates immediately on organisation switch
  - Warning/exhausted states at 80%/100% thresholds
- **Admin Database Reset**: Settings button to reset database (admin-only)
- **Notifications Dropdown**: Bell icon with notification list in global nav

### Changed

- **Polling Architecture**: Consolidated duplicate polling systems
  - Dashboard and job details now use single fallback polling mechanism
  - Polling only starts when Supabase Realtime fails (staging/preview)
  - Fallback polling stops when first real realtime event received
  - Removed unused auto-refresh code from BBDataBinder (~35 lines)
- **Quota Display**: Moved from settings-only to global nav
  - Cached DOM references for efficiency
  - Re-entrancy guard prevents concurrent fetches
  - 15-second timeout prevents hung requests blocking future updates

### Fixed

- **Staging Realtime**: Fixed polling not working on Supabase preview branches
  where realtime connects but events don't fire
- **Quota Init**: Fixed quota fetch failing when Supabase not ready
- **Org Init Race Conditions**: Unified org initialisation to prevent race
  conditions between nav and page scripts
- **Notification Security**: Validate notification link protocols before
  rendering

## [0.25.0] – 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Domain Search Attributes**: Shared domain search input with
  `bbb-domain-create` and `bbb-domain-search` attributes to control create
  behaviour and dropdown visibility across dashboard and GA workflows
- **GA4 Analytics Integration**: Full Google Analytics 4 Data API integration
  for page view analytics
  - Progressive fetching: initial 100 pages, then background loops of 1000-page
    batches (until 10k), then 50000-page batches until all pages fetched
  - OAuth token refresh with RFC 6749 compliant form-urlencoded requests
  - Thread-safe token management with automatic refresh on 401 responses
  - Triggered automatically when job created with `findLinks: true`

  - Domain tags UI on GA4 connections in integrations modal
  - Inline search input for domain selection with Enter key support
  - PATCH endpoint (`/v1/integrations/google/analytics/{id}/domains`) to update
    mappings
  - `domain_ids` array column on `google_analytics_connections` table
- **Domain Creation Endpoint**: Dedicated `/v1/domains` endpoint for creating
  domains without job side effects
- **Job Response Enhancement**: Job creation response now includes `domain_id`
- **Traffic-Based Task Prioritisation**: High-traffic pages now get prioritised
  in the crawl queue
  - Log-scaled view curve assigns scores from 0.10 to 0.99 based on 28-day page
    views
  - Pages with 0-1 views are excluded from analytics scoring
  - Uses `GREATEST(structural_priority, traffic_score)` so traffic and structure
    both contribute
  - Traffic scores calculated after GA4 fetch completes, applied to pending
    tasks for reprioritisation
  - Link discovery also applies traffic scores via `GREATEST`
- **Job Detail Analytics**: Job tasks and exports now include GA4 page views
  (7d, 28d, 180d)

### Changed

- **Go Version**: Updated to Go 1.25.6 for security fixes
- **Sitemap Baseline Priority**: Default sitemap task priority lowered to 0.1 to
  let GA4 traffic scores surface high-traffic pages

### Fixed

- **Domain Creation Race**: Fixed TOCTOU race with atomic
  `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT` pattern in `GetOrCreateDomainID`
- **Console Noise**: Removed verbose debug logging from GA4 integration and page
  load
- **GA Account Reuse**: Stored GA4 accounts now retry auth initialisation and
  fall back to connection tokens when account tokens are unavailable
- **GA4 Path Normalisation**: Analytics upserts now normalise GA4 page paths so
  traffic scores match task paths more reliably
- **Task Reprioritisation Logs**: Reduced noise when no tasks are updated after
  traffic scoring

## [0.24.3] – 2026-01-27

### Fixed

- **Dashboard Authentication Display**: Fixed bug where elements with
  CSS-defined `display` properties (e.g., `display: flex`) were incorrectly
  forced to `display: block` after authentication state changes
  - Auth elements now properly preserve CSS cascade by removing inline styles
    instead of applying default values
  - Fixes layout breakage in header elements (user info, auth buttons)
  - Resolves quota display not updating after organisation switch
  - Prevents capturing "none" as original display value

## [0.24.2] – 2026-01-26

### Added

- **Immediate Job Triggering**: Jobs now automatically triggered when enabling
  schedules or auto-publish webhooks for Webflow sites
  - Schedule enable/update creates immediate job with
    `source_type="schedule_setup"`
  - Auto-publish enable creates immediate job with
    `source_type="auto_publish_setup"`
  - Provides instant user feedback that automation features are working
  - Graceful error handling - feature enable succeeds even if job creation fails

## [0.24.1] – 2026-01-26

### Changed

- **Test Suite Simplification**: Reduced test suite by 73% (23,000→6,369 LOC,
  78→21 files)
  - Removed: Mock-heavy database tests, CRUD validation tests, manager/worker
    unit tests with extensive mocking
  - Kept: Security tests (JWT validation, webhook signatures, SSRF protection),
    compliance tests (robots.txt enforcement), algorithm tests (sitemap parsing,
    error classification, job lifecycle)
  - Philosophy: Test for breakage, not coverage. Focus on security boundaries
    and complex business logic
- **Documentation Updates**: Updated README and Roadmap to reflect
  security/compliance testing approach instead of coverage percentage targets
- **CI Configuration**: Removed coverage floor gates from CI workflow, kept
  Codecov for visibility only (informational, non-blocking)

## [0.23.0] – 2026-01-04

### Added

- **Per-site Webflow Configuration**: Site-level settings for connected Webflow
  workspaces
  - Site list shows connected Webflow sites with search and pagination
  - Per-site schedule dropdown (None/6h/12h/24h/48h) creates schedulers
    automatically

- **Webflow webhook registration**: Moved from bulk registration during OAuth to
  per-site toggle control
  - Webhook handler now validates `auto_publish_enabled` before triggering cache
    warming jobs
  - Improved domain resolution for Webflow API v2 (custom domains as objects,
    constructed default from shortName)

### Fixed

- Fixed schedule dropdown not working due to Webflow API v2 returning custom
  domains as objects instead of strings
- Fixed auto-publish toggle not responding to clicks (hidden checkbox event
  handling)

## [0.22.4] – 2026-01-04

### Changed

- Auto-release now runs on main pushes and only tags when the Unreleased section

  - `GetEffectiveOrganisationID()` provides backward compatibility (returns
    active org if set, otherwise legacy `organisation_id`)

### Security

- **Scheduler Jobs Query**: Fixed missing `organisation_id` filter in
  `getSchedulerJobs` query that could potentially expose jobs across
  organisations

### Changed

- **Organisation Scoping**: All 19 API endpoints now filter data by user's
  active organisation (4 dashboard, 8 jobs, 5 schedulers, 2 new org endpoints)
- **Stricter Validation**: Users without an organisation now receive HTTP 400
  "User must belong to an organisation" instead of empty results

    other pages); empty for 'sitemap' and 'manual' sources
  - `redirect_url` now only stored for significant redirects (different domain
    or path); trivial redirects (HTTP→HTTPS, www→non-www, trailing slash) no
    longer stored

## [0.18.9] – 2025-12-29

## [0.18.8] – 2025-12-27

## [0.18.7] – 2025-12-25

### Changed

- **Restart Job Simplification**: Frontend now handles job restart via standard
  creation endpoint

    defaults if missing); resets: use_sitemap=true
  - Removed backend `StartJob` and `restartJob` functions (~700 lines deleted)
  - Eliminates duplicate job creation logic and missing field bugs
  - **Breaking**: Restart endpoint removed and PUT actions restricted:
    - `/v1/jobs/:id/restart` endpoint no longer exists
    - `PUT /v1/jobs/:id` now only accepts `action="cancel"` (start/restart
      actions removed)
    - To restart a job: fetch config via `GET /v1/jobs/:id`, then
      `POST /v1/jobs` with the retrieved settings

## [0.18.6] – 2025-12-25

### Added

- **API Endpoints**: Added `/restart` and `/cancel` endpoints for job management

### Enhanced

- **Worker Notification**: Workers are now notified immediately after task
  creation for faster job processing
- **Robots.txt Handling**: Use default `*` rules and ignore SEO bot-specific
  rules for improved crawling
- **Robots.txt Delay**: Apply 50% multiplier to robots.txt crawl-delay values
  for more conservative rate limiting

### Fixed

- **Job Cancellation**: Fixed race condition in job cancellation logic
- **CancelJob Endpoint**: Now returns database errors properly
- **Crawl Delay**: Fixed multiplier logic to correctly override stored delay
  values
- **Deadlock Retry**: PostgreSQL deadlock errors (40P01) now correctly trigger
  transaction retry

## [0.18.4] – 2025-12-24

## [0.18.3] – 2025-12-24

## [0.18.2] – 2025-12-24

### Added

- **Job Details Metadata**: Display additional job configuration in overview
  grid
  - Concurrency, max pages, and source type from jobs table
  - Crawl delay and adaptive delay from domains table

### Enhanced

- **Adaptive Rate Limiting**: Faster delay recovery and smarter task claiming
  - Reduced probe threshold from 20 to 5 consecutive successes before attempting
    lower delay
  - Reduced delay step from 1s to 500ms for finer-grained adjustments
  - Recovery from 21s → 10s adaptive delay now takes ~5.5 minutes instead of ~59
    minutes
  - Added `BBB_RATE_LIMIT_DELAY_STEP_MS` environment variable for operational
    tuning
- **Worker Task Claiming**: Workers now skip domains that aren't available yet
  - Added `EstimatedWait()` method to DomainLimiter for checking domain
    availability
  - Workers check domain availability before claiming tasks, allowing them to
    work on other jobs instead of blocking
  - Optimised lock contention by snapshotting job info cache before iteration

### Fixed

- **Job Details Page Task Filters**: Fixed non-functional filter buttons and
  search input on job details page
  - Added missing `cacheFilter` and `pathFilter` state properties
  - Implemented path keyword search with 300ms debounce (min 3 characters)
  - Fixed filter coordination so selecting status/cache filters clears path
    search and vice versa
  - Hit/Miss cache filter buttons now work correctly
- **Console Log Noise**: Removed verbose dashboard refresh logging
  - Eliminated "Refreshing dashboard data..." log message
  - Removed "Dashboard data refreshed" log with stats object
- **Password Strength Warning**: Silenced "Password strength checking not
  available" console warning on pages without signup forms
  - setupPasswordStrength() now exits silently when signup form elements aren't
    present
  - Password strength checking still works correctly on actual signup forms

## [0.18.1] – 2025-12-22

## [0.18.0] – 2025-12-22

### Added

- Recurring job scheduling system with support for 6, 12, 24, and 48-hour
  intervals
- Scheduler management API endpoints (`/v1/schedulers`) for creating, updating,
  deleting, and listing schedules
- Dashboard UI for managing schedules with enable/disable, view jobs, and delete
  functionality
- Schedule dropdown in job creation modal to optionally create recurring
  schedules
- Background scheduler service that checks for ready schedules every 30 seconds
  and creates jobs automatically
- Jobs created from schedulers are linked via `scheduler_id` and marked with
  `source_type='scheduler'`

### Fixed

- Replaced string error comparisons with sentinel errors
  (`ErrSchedulerNotFound`) for proper error handling
- Fixed N+1 query pattern in `startJobScheduler` by batching domain name lookups
- Added `GetDomainNames()` and `GetDomainNameByID()` helper functions to
  eliminate duplicate domain lookup code
- Improved validation: `ScheduleIntervalHours` now uses pointer type for
  explicit optional updates in API requests
- Added comprehensive aria-labels to all interactive elements in dashboard for
  improved accessibility
- Extracted time formatting logic into reusable `formatNextRunTime()` helper
  function

### Changed

- Scheduler API now uses pointer types for optional update fields to make intent
  explicit (nil = no update, value = update requested)
- Domain lookups now use consistent helper functions across scheduler code,
  eliminating inline queries

## [0.17.13] – 2025-12-02

### Changed

- Default job concurrency increased from 5 to 20 for dashboard/API jobs and from
  3 to 20 for webhook jobs; maximum allowed concurrency raised from 20 to 100.
- Dashboard auto-refresh interval reduced from 10 seconds to 1 second.
- Job details page now auto-refreshes every 1 second while job is
  running/pending, stopping automatically when job completes.
- Workers now stagger startup by 50ms each to prevent thundering herd on cold
  start and scale-up events.

### Added

- Concurrency dropdown added to dashboard job creation form with "Default"
  option (uses server default of 20) plus values 1-100.
- Webhook endpoint now accepts optional `?concurrency=N` query parameter to
  override the default concurrency for Webflow-triggered jobs.

### Removed

- Removed manual refresh interval dropdown from dashboard form (auto-refresh is
  now always enabled at 1 second).

## [0.17.12] – 2025-11-16

## [0.17.11] – 2025-11-16

## [0.17.10] – 2025-11-16

### Changed

- Batch manager now defaults to a 2 s flush interval with a 2000-item channel,
  and both settings can be tuned via `BBB_BATCH_MAX_INTERVAL_MS` and
  `BBB_BATCH_CHANNEL_SIZE` (clamped to 100‑10 000 ms and 500‑20 000 items) to
  absorb heavy task churn without blocking workers.
- Running task slot releases flush pending batches before falling back to a
  direct `DecrementRunningTasksBy` call, and the fallback timeout was extended
  (15 s) to avoid spurious "DecrementRunningTasksBy database error" warnings
  during spikes.
- CLI auth flow now has a dedicated `cli-login.html` that reuses the Supabase
  modal without leaking users' sessions, and the helper
  (`scripts/auth/cli_auth.py`) drives browser-based login, handles CORS
  securely, and caches tokens for load test scripts.

## [0.17.9] – 2025-11-15

## [0.17.8] – 2025-11-15

### Fixed

- Queue worker now inspects per-job counters before removing jobs, requeues
  stale running tasks, promotes waiting work into pending slots, and
  auto-completes jobs whose tasks finished—eliminating the stuck task warnings
  seen in Sentry.
- `CreatePageRecords` processes discovered links in ≤250 item batches using a
  single `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE RETURNING` upsert, preventing
  long-running transactions and the "transaction already committed"/timeout
  alerts.
- Cloudflare Turnstile signup flow resets tokens on every attempt, retries error
  106010 challenges automatically, and emits `turnstile.*` telemetry to Sentry
  capturing token age, retries, and lifecycle transitions for better
  diagnostics.
- Orphaned task cleanup now batches updates (1000 at a time) to avoid hitting
  statement timeouts on jobs with huge backlogs, eliminating the repeated
  "Failed to cleanup orphaned tasks" log spam.

## [0.17.7] – 2025-11-10

## [0.17.6] – 2025-11-09

## [0.17.5] – 2025-11-09

- Queue claiming:
  - Removed the standalone `jobHasCapacityTx` / `jobHasPendingTasksTx`
    pre-checks (and their `FOR SHARE` locks) so workers no longer lock a job row
    twice before updating `running_tasks`.
  - All concurrency/emptiness checks now happen inside the existing claim CTE,
    eliminating the lock-upgrade deadlocks introduced in the 0.17.0
    optimisations.

## [0.17.4] – 2025-11-09

## [0.17.3] – 2025-11-08

## [0.17.2] – 2025-11-08

- Queue stability improvements:
  - Added `jobs.pending_tasks` / `jobs.waiting_tasks` counters plus a backfill +
    trigger to keep them in sync.
  - `EnqueueURLs` and the idle monitor now read those counters under
    `FOR UPDATE`, so pending slots are computed accurately without scanning
    `tasks`.
  - Worker rebalancer logs aggregated queue depth and demotes overflow pending
    rows using the counters (no more full-table queries).

## [0.17.0] – 2025-11-08

Series of minor optimisations to improve throughput and resource usage.

### Changed

- **Database Connection Pool**: Increased production connection pool from 37 to
  70 max connections (idle: 15 → 20)
  - Utilises available Supabase capacity (90 max connections)
  - Provides better concurrency during load bursts
  - Leaves 20 connections headroom for admin/monitoring
  - With Supavisor transaction pooling: ~150 MB memory impact (70 logical →
    ~10-15 actual connections)

### Enhanced

- **Task Claim Performance**: Optimised hot path with covering indexes and
  capacity pre-checks
  - Added partial indexes on tasks(job_id, priority_score, created_at) and
    jobs(id) with INCLUDE columns
  - Pre-check job capacity before expensive claim query (eliminates wasted CTE
    executions)
  - Replaced COUNT(\*) concurrency checks with EXISTS queries (faster
    short-circuit evaluation)
- **Batch Task Enqueuing**: Improved throughput for bulk task creation
  - Batch INSERT operations for discovered links and sitemap URLs
  - Reduced per-task overhead during link discovery phase
- **Worker Scaling Observability**: Scaling decisions now log their reason,
  worker deltas, and job counts
  - Captures `scale_up`, `scale_down`, and `no_change` outcomes with contextual
    metadata
  - Emergency/idle scale-down paths surface cooldowns, idle worker counts, and
    total job concurrency
- **Waiting Task Telemetry**: Added structured logging + metrics for tasks
  entering the `waiting` state
  - Records waiting reason (`concurrency_limit`, `blocking_retry`,
    `retryable_error`) and per-job counts via OpenTelemetry counter
  - Worker retries now emit explicit waiting reason logs to correlate backlog
    with root cause
- **Job Info Fetching**: Worker pool now deduplicates database lookups for job
  metadata via singleflight caching
  - Concurrent AddJob/prepareTask calls share the same DB query for domain info
  - Cache fallbacks reuse the same loader, eliminating redundant queries under
    load
- **Priority Update Debounce**: Prevents redundant sitemap/link priority updates
  during bursts
  - High-priority pages still update immediately; mid-tier waits 5s, low-tier
    30s between updates
  - Skips DB work when no lower-priority tasks exist or when cooldown is active
- **Job Info Cache Metrics**: Added hit/miss/invalidation counters and
  cache-size gauge
  - Worker pool logs cache hits/misses per job and exposes Grafana-friendly
    metrics for dashboarding

### Added

- **Load Test Analysis**: Comprehensive documentation of 82-minute 10x load test
  results
  - Documented priority update storm, waiting task backlog, worker scaling,
    cache behaviour, DB transactions
  - Resource utilisation analysis (Supabase memory/CPU scaling patterns)
  - Phased optimisation recommendations (immediate, short-term, long-term)
- **Database Optimisation Research**: Documented query performance bottlenecks
  and index recommendations
  - CTE claim query analysis (~53% total time), running_tasks counter contention
    (~20%), INSERT conflicts (~19%)
  - Covering index recommendations, batch update strategies, connection pooling
    guidance
- **Pages Lookup Index**: Added composite index on `pages(domain_id, path)` to
  accelerate path lookups during task enqueue and deduplication

### Removed

- **Legacy Load Test Scripts**: Deleted outdated `load-test-simple.sh` and
  README in favour of generate-test-jobs utility

## [0.16.13] – 2025-11-07

### Fixed

- **Orphaned Task Cleanup**: Resolved systemic issue where orphaned tasks from
  failed jobs weren't being cleaned up
  - Moved cleanup from 60-second maintenance transaction to dedicated goroutine
    running every 30 seconds
  - Processes entire jobs at once with no timeout constraint (eliminates O(n²)
    trigger overhead risk)
  - Handles jobs with 50,000+ orphaned tasks without timing out
  - Fixed job selection query: replaced invalid `SELECT DISTINCT` with `EXISTS`
    subquery (PostgreSQL incompatibility with `ORDER BY` + `FOR UPDATE`)
  - Fixed CancelJob to mark both 'pending' and 'waiting' tasks as skipped
    (previously only handled 'pending')
  - Added comprehensive integration tests covering failed job cleanup, cancelled
    job exclusion, and incremental processing
  - Expected impact: Prevents 16,000+ task backlogs from accumulating over weeks

## [0.16.12] – 2025-11-07

### Changed

- **Dependency Refresh**: Bumped key libraries to their latest stable releases
  before launch
  - sentry-go 0.32.0 → 0.36.2, golang-jwt/jwt/v5 5.2.2 → 5.3.0, pgx/v5 5.7.5 →
    5.7.6, prometheus/client_golang 1.23.0 → 1.23.2, golang.org/x/time 0.11.0 →
    0.14.0
  - Prometheus stack (common, procfs, otlptranslator) and grpc/genproto/
    protobuf modules updated to latest patch levels
  - Miscellaneous indirect upgrades (xmlquery/xpath, bitset, objx, go-difflib,
    go-edlib, OTel auto SDK) via `go get -u ./...`

## [0.17.0] – 2025-11-07

### Fixed

- **OpenTelemetry WriteHeader Warnings**: Eliminated "superfluous
  response.WriteHeader" warnings in production logs
  - Upgraded otelhttp from v0.54.0 to v0.63.0 (includes fix from PR #6055)
  - Fixed known bug in otelhttp response writer wrapper
    (open-telemetry/opentelemetry-go-contrib#6053)
  - Warnings were occurring on static file routes (/, /robots.txt, /dashboard)

### Changed

- **OpenTelemetry Upgrade**: Major update to observability stack
  - Core OTel packages: v1.32.0 → v1.38.0 (6 minor versions)
  - OTel SDK: v1.32.0 → v1.38.0

  - WARN-level logging for duplicate WriteHeader attempts with stack traces
  - DEBUG-level logging for all WriteHeader calls
  - Zero performance impact when not in debug mode

## [0.16.11] – 2025-11-07

## [0.16.10] – 2025-11-07

### Fixed

- **Duplicate Job Checking**: Fixed job duplicate checking for users without
  organisations
  - Previously checked `user_id IS NULL AND organisation_id = $1` when user had
    no organisation, causing check to fail
  - Now uses `user_id = $1 AND organisation_id IS NULL` to correctly match
    user-created jobs
  - Prevents false duplicate job creation for users without organisation
    assignments

### Added

- **Organisation Auto-Join**: Business email users now automatically join
  existing organisations
  - Added `GetOrganisationByName()` for case-insensitive organisation lookup
  - Added `isBusinessEmail()` to distinguish business vs personal email domains
  - When users sign up with business emails (e.g., `@teamharvey.co`), they
    automatically join existing organisation instead of creating duplicate
  - Personal email users continue to get individual organisations
  - Example: Second user signing up with `@acme.com` joins existing "Acme"
    organisation

- **Smart Organisation Names**: Organisation names now intelligently derived
  from email addresses
  - Business emails derive org name from domain: `simon@teamharvey.co` →
    "Teamharvey"
  - Personal emails with full name use the name: `user@gmail.com` + "John Doe" →
    "John Doe"
  - Personal emails without name use email prefix: `simon.smallchua@gmail.com` →
    "Simon.Smallchua Organisation"
  - Supports common TLDs (.com, .co.uk, .com.au, .io, .ai, .dev, .net, .org)
  - Recognises personal email providers: Gmail, Outlook, Hotmail, Yahoo, iCloud,
    ProtonMail, AOL, Zoho, Fastmail

## [0.16.9] – 2025-11-05

## [0.16.8] – 2025-11-04

## [0.16.7] – 2025-11-04

### Fixed

- **Worker Pool Error Logging**: Fixed spurious error logs for concurrency
  blocking in `GetNextTask` retry wrapper
  - Added check for `ErrConcurrencyBlocked` before error logging at retry
    summary level
  - Eliminates "Error getting next pending task" logs when tasks are blocked by
    concurrency limits
  - Completes the fix from 0.16.6 - now all code paths handle concurrency
    blocking gracefully

## [0.16.6] – 2025-11-03

### Fixed

- **Worker Pool Query Spam**: Fixed critical issue where workers hammered
  database with 200+ queries/second during concurrency blocking
  - Workers now detect when all pending tasks are blocked by job concurrency
    limits (`ErrConcurrencyBlocked`)
  - `claimPendingTask` gracefully handles concurrency-blocked jobs without error
    logging
  - Exponential backoff (200ms → 5s) applied when tasks exist but are
    concurrency-blocked
  - Expected impact: Reduce database queries from ~3,600/sec to <20/sec during
    high concurrency blocking
  - Prevents CPU throttling and machine restarts from excessive query load
  - Maintains same throughput - only reduces wasteful database polling

## [0.16.5] – 2025-11-03

### Added

- **Idle Worker Scaling & Health Probe**: Automatic worker pool management to
  reduce database query spam during concurrency blocking
  - Idle worker tracking scales down workers when all are idle and no work is
    available (configurable via `BBB_WORKER_IDLE_THRESHOLD`, default: disabled)
  - Health probe periodically checks for work to wake idle workers (configurable
    via `BBB_HEALTH_PROBE_INTERVAL_SECONDS`, default: disabled)
  - Calculates needed workers based on effective job concurrency accounting for
    domain throttling
  - Expected impact: ~3,600 queries/sec → <10 queries/sec during idle periods,
    maintaining <30s wake-up latency
  - Both features disabled by default for backwards compatibility

### Fixed

- **Race Conditions in Worker Pool**: Resolved critical concurrency issues in
  idle worker tracking
  - Fixed map panic from concurrent read/write on `idleWorkers` map by capturing
    count inside mutex lock
  - Cleared stale worker IDs during scale-down to prevent perpetual "all idle"
    state causing health probe spam
  - Removed unused `probeJobIndex` field to avoid confusion

## [0.16.4] – 2025-11-03

- Batch manager flushes (including poison-pill fallbacks) now run with 30-second
  contexts so task updates cannot hang indefinitely.
- Added `ExecuteWithContext` with proper retry/backoff and migrated
  `DecrementRunningTasks` plus mocks/tests to honour these deadlines.
- Queue workers now propagate bounded contexts through database writes,
  eliminating silent stalls under load.
- Added a `--log-level` CLI flag that overrides `LOG_LEVEL` for quick production
  debugging.

## [0.16.3] – 2025-11-03

### Added

- **Database Connection Resilience**: Implemented exponential backoff retry
  logic for database connections to prevent crash-looping during Supabase
  maintenance windows
  - Created `internal/db/retry.go` with configurable retry mechanisms
  - Added `WaitForDatabase()` function with up to 5-minute wait period
  - Added `InitFromURLWithSuffixRetry()` for queue database connections
  - Application now gracefully waits for database availability instead of
    crash-looping when Supabase terminates connections (SQLSTATE 57P01)
  - Retry configuration: 10 attempts max, 1s-30s exponential backoff with jitter
  - Prevents Fly.io machine restart exhaustion (observed: 10 restarts over 5
    hours)

## [0.16.2] – 2025-11-02

### Fixed

- **Pending Queue Overflow**: Fixed pending task queue flooding to 2,673 tasks
  (should be 50-100)
  - Root cause analysis identified three critical issues causing queue overflow:
    1. Unlimited concurrency jobs (NULL/0) set availableSlots to number of pages
       (hundreds/thousands)
    2. Task retries bypassed pending queue cap by going directly to 'pending'
       status
    3. Domain limiter concurrency overrides ignored when calculating available
       slots
  - **Fix #1**: Capped unlimited concurrency jobs to maximum 100 pending tasks
  - **Fix #2**: Routed all retry paths (blocking errors 403/429/503 and
    retryable errors) through 'waiting' status instead of directly to 'pending'
    - Added `TaskStatusWaiting` constant to task status enum
    - Modified retry logic in worker.go to set status to 'waiting' instead of
      'pending'
    - Ensures retries respect the pending queue capacity cap
  - **Fix #3**: Implemented domain limiter concurrency override support in
    availableSlots calculation
    - Added `ConcurrencyOverrideFunc` callback mechanism to DbQueue
    - Created `GetEffectiveConcurrency()` method on DomainLimiter to expose
      adaptive throttling limits
    - Modified `EnqueueURLs()` to query domain name and apply
      `min(configuredConcurrency, limiterOverride)`
    - Prevents over-promotion when domains are being adaptively throttled
  - Updated unit tests to match new SQL query pattern with domain JOIN
  - Expected improvement: Pending queue stays at 50-100 tasks instead of
    flooding to 2,600+

## [0.16.1] – 2025-11-02

## [0.16.0] – 2025-11-02

### Fixed

- **Queue Performance Bottleneck**: Eliminated GetNextTask query performance
  degradation causing 5ms-107s variance (21,000x)
  - Root cause: Query scanned ~5,000 pending tasks looking for jobs with
    available concurrency, causing table scan under load
  - Introduced 'waiting' status for tasks blocked by job concurrency limits
  - Only 'pending' tasks are now eligible for claiming, reducing typical scan
    from 5,000 rows to <100 rows (98% reduction)
  - Added capacity-aware enqueueing:
    `available_slots = concurrency - (running_tasks + existing_pending_count)`
  - New tasks only set to 'pending' if job has available capacity slots,
    remainder go to 'waiting'
  - Migration includes backfill UPDATE to immediately move existing blocked
    pending tasks to waiting status
  - DecrementRunningTasks now automatically promotes one waiting task to pending
    when capacity frees
  - Created partial indexes `idx_tasks_pending_ready` and
    `idx_tasks_waiting_by_job` for optimised scans
  - Added database functions `promote_waiting_task_for_job()` and
    `job_has_capacity()` for atomic state transitions
  - Expected improvement: Query times from 5-107s to consistent <10ms, reduced
    pool contention, improved throughput

### Added

- **Adaptive Domain Rate Limiter**: Shared per-domain throttle with persistence
  and concurrency management to prevent 429 cascades
  - Learns delays based on blocking responses and writes them back via
    `adaptive_delay_seconds` / `adaptive_delay_floor_seconds`
  - Applies shared backoff windows, linear (+1 s) growth, probing after
    sustained success, and concurrency reduction for heavily throttled domains
  - Configurable via `BBB_RATE_LIMIT_BASE_DELAY_MS`,
    `BBB_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_DELAY_SECONDS`, `BBB_RATE_LIMIT_SUCCESS_THRESHOLD`, and
    `BBB_RATE_LIMIT_MAX_RETRIES`
- **Queue Status Flow Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation of task
  lifecycle and status split solution
  - Visual state machine diagrams showing pending/waiting/running/completed
    transitions
  - Capacity calculation examples with concrete scenarios
  - Query performance before/after comparisons with scan size analysis
  - Implementation details for capacity-aware enqueueing and atomic promotion
  - Edge case handling documentation (no concurrency limit, concurrent
    completions, migration timing)
- **Job Failure Guardrail**: Worker pool stops jobs after configurable
  consecutive task failures (`BBB_JOB_FAILURE_THRESHOLD`, default 20) to
  preserve resources when domains remain blocked indefinitely

## [0.15.0] – 2025-10-29

### Added

- Optional `DATABASE_QUEUE_URL` so the worker queue can use a dedicated
  session-mode Postgres connection while the rest of the app remains on the
  pooled endpoint
- Workflow flag `[preview app]` now opt-in deploys GitHub PR preview apps;
  previews are skipped by default to reduce noise

### Changed

- Introduced an in-process semaphore and bounded retry/backoff logic around the
  task queue transactions (`DB_QUEUE_MAX_CONCURRENCY`, `DB_TX_MAX_RETRIES`,
  `DB_TX_BACKOFF_BASE_MS`, `DB_TX_BACKOFF_MAX_MS`) to keep Supabase from
  saturating under bursts
- Startup now reuses the shared pool for general queries while routing queue
  traffic through the optional connection, improving resilience during deploys
- Cache-warming second crawls now use a 500–1000 ms jittered delay with only
  three lightweight HEAD probes, cutting typical task time from ~17 s to under
  8 s

### Fixed

- Cleaned up recent migration churn (`running_tasks` counter column, timing
  columns, job status CTE) so all environments apply schema changes without
  manual intervention

## [0.14.2] – 2025-10-29

## [0.14.1] – 2025-10-26

## [0.14.0] – 2025-10-26

### Enhanced

- **Worker Pool Throughput**: Eliminated 5-second batch delay bottleneck in task
  claiming
  - Decoupled `running_tasks` counter decrement from batch updates for immediate
    concurrency slot release
  - Workers now claim tasks immediately after completion instead of waiting for
    batch flush (up to 5 seconds)
  - Added atomic `DecrementRunningTasks()` function to `DbQueueInterface` for
    immediate counter updates
  - Removed counter decrements from all 4 batch update queries (completed,
    failed, skipped, pending)
  - Batch manager continues to handle detailed field updates efficiently (95%
    transaction reduction maintained)
  - Expected improvement: 15-20 tasks/min → ~180 tasks/min (12× throughput
    increase)
  - Single atomic UPDATE per task completion adds negligible database load
  - Both success and error paths now decrement counters immediately for
    consistent behaviour

### Changed

- **Database Connection Tracking**: Enhanced connection management and cleanup
  - Added application name tracking for connection identification in PostgreSQL
  - Implemented automatic cleanup of stale connections from previous deployments
    on startup
  - Enhanced connection string builder with parameter sanitisation and
    validation
  - Added support for detecting and terminating idle connections from previous
    application instances
  - Connection strings now include `idle_in_transaction_session_timeout` and
    `statement_timeout` for stability

## [0.13.0] – 2025-10-25

### Enhanced

- **Worker Pool Efficiency**: Eliminated redundant database queries during link
  discovery
  - Cached `domain_id` in job info to avoid per-task lookups (50+ queries/second
    reduction)
  - Reduced connection pool pressure by 15-20% during high-throughput operations
  - Added defensive guard for missing domain context to prevent silent failures
  - Enhanced test coverage with explicit assertions for domain ID propagation

### Fixed

- **Pool Saturation During Link Discovery**: Workers no longer hit connection
  pool limits when processing discovered links
  - Root cause: Each completed task queried `SELECT domain_id FROM jobs`
    individually
  - Solution: Domain ID now flows through cached job info → task → link
    processing
  - Impact: Link enqueueing now succeeds consistently, enabling full crawl depth

## [0.12.3] – 2025-10-25

## [0.12.1] – 2025-10-25

## [0.12.0] – 2025-10-24

### Enhanced

- **Database Performance Optimisation**: Critical scaling improvements for
  concurrent job processing
  - Added 9 foreign key indexes reducing lock wait times from 2-6s to <100ms
    (20x improvement)
  - Optimised RLS policies wrapping auth.uid() in SELECT for 10,000x reduction
    in per-row evaluation overhead
  - Refactored task claiming to use single CTE query combining SELECT + UPDATE
    (50% fewer round trips)
  - Split RLS policies for shared resources: relaxed INSERT for workers, strict
    SELECT via jobs, UPDATE restricted to service role only
  - Expected improvements: 2x task throughput (400-550/min → 800-1,000/min),
    2-10x concurrent job capacity (5 → 10-50+)

## [0.11.1] – 2025-10-24

### Fixed

  timezone instead of UTC
  - Added automatic timezone detection using browser's IANA timezone string
    (e.g., "Australia/Sydney")
  - Backend converts "today"/"yesterday" boundaries to user's timezone with
    graceful UTC fallback
  - Added "Last Hour" and "Last 24 Hours" rolling window filters alongside
    existing calendar-day filters

    connections
  - **Development**: 5 workers (max 50), 3 max connections, 1 idle connection
  - Dynamic worker scaling enforces environment-specific limits in AddJob and
    performance-based scaling
  - Prevents preview apps from scaling beyond their connection pool capacity
  - Prevents resource exhaustion during PR testing
  - Stays well under Supabase's 48-connection pool limit
  - Development uses minimal connections to allow multiple local instances

## [0.9.0] – 2025-10-20

### Fixed

- **Task Recovery System**: Rewrote stuck task recovery to use batch processing
  - Processes stuck tasks in batches of 100 (oldest first) preventing
    transaction timeouts
  - Failed batches use exponential backoff and bail out after 5 consecutive
    failures to prevent database hammering
  - Tasks from cancelled/failed jobs are marked as failed immediately instead of
    retrying
  - Increased maintenance statement timeout from 5s to 30s to allow recovery
    batches to complete when processing large backlogs
  - Fixes issue where thousands of tasks could remain stuck indefinitely due to
    all-or-nothing transaction rollbacks
- **Monitoring and Alerting**: Reduced Sentry event spam whilst improving alert
  quality
  - Reduced stuck task monitoring from every 5 seconds to every 5 minutes
  - Replaced per-task Sentry events with single aggregated alert reporting
    actual totals (not sample size)

  (Webflow) rather than using user ID

### Fixed

- **Account creation**: New accounts weren't being created and org name was
  wrong
  - Updated sign in or create account to create a new profile
  - Fix logic to create org name based on domain

- **Supabase / Github workflow**: Fixed schema issues with main vs. test-branch

## [0.5.29] – 2025-07-26

### Added

- **Sitemap Fallback**: Falls back to crawling from root page when sitemap
  unavailable
- **Database Migrations**: Transitioned to migration-based database management

## [0.5.28] – 2025-07-19

### Fixed

- **Memory Leak**: Removed unbounded in-memory HTTP cache that was causing
  memory exhaustion during crawl jobs. The cache was storing entire HTML pages
  without eviction, leading to out-of-memory crashes.

## [0.5.27] – 2025-07-19

### Enhanced

- **DB Optimisation**: Implemented a bunch of indexes on Supabase tables and
  deleted all historical data on pages/domains/tasks/jobs to clean and speed up.

## [0.5.26] – 2025-07-07

### Enhanced

- **Crawler Efficiency**: Implemented an in-memory cache for the HTTP client
  used by the crawler. This significantly reduces bandwidth and speeds up
  crawling by preventing the repeated download of assets (like JavaScript and
  CSS) within the same crawl job.

## [0.5.25] – 2025-07-06

### Github action updates

- **Codecov**: Implemented integration to report on testing coverage, indicated
  in badge in README
- **Go Report**: Added code quality reporting into README

## [0.5.24] – 2025-07-06

### Security

- **CSRF Protection**: Implemented global Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
  protection by adding Go 1.25's experimental `http.CrossOriginProtection`
  middleware to all API endpoints. This hardens the application against
  malicious cross-origin requests that could otherwise perform unauthorised
  actions on behalf of an authenticated user.

## [0.5.23] – 2025-07-06

### Added

- **Performance Debugging**: Implemented Go's built-in flight recorder
  (`runtime/trace`) to allow for in-depth performance analysis of the
  application in production environments. The trace data is accessible via the
  `/debug/fgtrace` endpoint.

### Fixed

- **Flight Recorder**: Corrected the flight recorder's shutdown logic to ensure
  `trace.Stop()` is called during graceful server shutdown instead of
  immediately on startup. This allows the recorder to capture the full
  application lifecycle, making it usable for production performance debugging.

## [0.5.22] – 2025-07-03

### Enhanced

- **Database Performance**: Implemented an in-memory cache for page lookups
  (`pages` table) to significantly reduce redundant "upsert" queries. This
  dramatically improves performance during the page creation phase of a job by
  caching results for URLs that are processed multiple times within the same
  job.

## [0.5.21] – 2025-07-03

### Changed

- **Database Driver**: Switched the PostgreSQL driver from `lib/pq` to the more
  modern and performant `pgx`.
  - This resolves underlying issues with connection poolers (like Supabase
    PgBouncer) without requiring connection string workarounds.
  - The `prepare_threshold=0` setting is no longer needed and has been removed.
- **Notification System**: Rewrote the database notification listener
  (`LISTEN/NOTIFY`) to use `pgx`'s native, more robust implementation, improving
  real-time worker notifications.

### Enhanced

- **Database Performance**: Optimised the `tasks` table indexing for faster
  worker performance.
  - Replaced several general-purpose indexes with a highly specific partial
    index (`idx_tasks_pending_claim_order`) for the critical task-claiming
    query.
  - This significantly improves the speed and scalability of task processing by
    eliminating expensive sorting operations.

### Fixed

- **Graceful Shutdown**: Fixed an issue where the new `pgx`-based notification
  listener would not terminate correctly during a graceful shutdown, preventing
  the worker pool from stopping cleanly.

## [0.5.20] – 2025-07-03

### Added

- **Cache Warming Auditing**: Added detailed auditing for the cache warming
  retry mechanism.
  - The `tasks` table now includes a `cache_check_attempts` JSONB column to
    store the results of each `HEAD` request check.
  - Each attempt logs the cache status and the delay before the check.

### Enhanced

- **Cache Warming Strategy**: Improved the cache warming retry logic for more
  robust cache verification.
  - Increased the maximum number of `HEAD` check retries from 5 to 10.
  - Implemented a progressive backoff for the delay between checks, starting at
    2 seconds and increasing by 1 second for each subsequent attempt.

### Fixed

- **Database Connection Stability**: Resolved a critical issue causing
  `driver: bad connection` and `unexpected Parse response` errors when using a
  connection pooler (like Supabase PgBouncer).
  - The PostgreSQL connection string now includes `prepare_threshold=0` to
    disable server-side prepared statements, ensuring compatibility with
    transaction-based poolers.
  - Added an automatic schema migration (`ALTER TABLE`) to ensure the
    `cache_check_attempts` column is added to existing databases.

## [0.5.19] – 2025-07-02

### Enhanced

- **Task Prioritisation**: Refactored job initiation and link discovery for more
  accurate and efficient priority assignment.
  - The separate, post-sitemap homepage scan for header/footer links has been
    removed, eliminating a redundant HTTP request and potential race conditions.
  - The homepage (`/`) is now assigned a priority of `1.000` directly during
    sitemap processing.
  - Link discovery logic is now context-aware:
    - On the homepage, links in the `<header>` are assigned priority `1.000`,
      and links in the `<footer>` get `0.990`.
    - On all other pages, links within `<header>` and `<footer>` are ignored,
      preventing low-value navigation links from being crawled repeatedly.
    - Links in the page body inherit their priority from the parent page as
      before.

## [0.5.18] – 2025-07-02

### Enhanced

- **Crawler Efficiency**: Implemented a comprehensive visibility check to
  prevent the crawler from processing links that are hidden. The check includes
  inline styles (`display: none`, `visibility: hidden`), common utility classes
  (`hide`, `d-none`, `sr-only`, etc.), and attributes like `aria-hidden="true"`,
  `data-hidden`, and `data-visible="false"`. This significantly reduces the
  number of unnecessary tasks created.

## [0.5.17] – 2025-07-02

### Added

- **Task Logging**: Included the `priority_score` in the log message when a task
  is claimed by a worker for improved debugging.

### Fixed

- **Crawler Stability**: Fixed an infinite loop issue where relative links
  containing only a query string (e.g., `?page=2`) were repeatedly appended to
  the current URL instead of replacing the existing query.

## [0.5.16] – 2025-07-02

### Enhanced

- **User Registration**: The default organisation name is now set to the user's
  full name upon registration for a more personalized experience.
- **Organisation Name Cleanup**: Organisation names derived from email addresses
  are now cleaned of common TLDs (e.g., `.com`), ignores generic domains, and
  doesn't capitalise.

### Fixed

- **Database Efficiency**: Removed a redundant database call in the page
  creation process by passing the domain name as a parameter.
- **Task Auditing**: Ensured that the `retry_count` for a task is correctly
  preserved when a task succeeds after one or more retries.

## [0.5.15] – 2025-07-02

### Changed

- **Codebase Cleanup**: Numerous small changes to improve code clarity,
  including fixing comment typos, removing unused code, and standardising
  function names.
- **Worker Pool Logic**: Simplified worker scaling logic and reduced worker
  sleep time to improve responsiveness.

### Fixed

- **Architectural Consistency**: Corrected a flaw where the `WorkerPool` did not
  correctly use the `JobManager` for enqueueing tasks, ensuring
  duplicate-checking logic is now properly applied.

### Documentation

- **Project Management**: Updated `TODO.md` to convert all file references to
  clickable links and consolidated several in-code `TODO` comments into the main
  file for better tracking.
- **AI Collaboration**: Added `gemini.md` to document the best practices and
  working protocols for AI collaboration on this project.
- **Language Standardisation**: Renamed `Serialize` function to `Serialise` to
  maintain British English consistency throughout the codebase.

## [0.5.14] – 2025-06-26

### Added

- **Task Prioritisation Implementation**: Implemented priority-based task
  processing system
  - Added `priority_score` column to tasks table (0.000-1.000 range)
  - Tasks now processed by priority score (DESC) then creation time (ASC)
  - Homepage automatically gets priority 1.000 after sitemap processing
  - Header links (detected by common paths) also get priority 1.000
  - Discovered links inherit 80% of source page priority (propagation)
  - Added index `idx_tasks_priority` for efficient priority-based queries
  - All tasks start at 0.000 and only increase based on criteria

### Enhanced

- **Task Processing Order**: Changed from FIFO to priority-based processing
  - High-value pages (homepage, header links) crawled first
  - Important pages discovered early get higher priority
  - Ensures critical site pages are cached before less important ones

### Fixed

- **Recrawl pages with EXPIRED cache status**

## [0.5.13] – 2025-06-26

### Added

- **Task Prioritisation Planning**: Created comprehensive plan for
  priority-based task processing
  - PostgreSQL view-based approach using percentage scores (0.0-1.0)
  - Minimal schema changes - only adds `priority_score` column to pages table
  - Homepage detection and automatic highest priority assignment
  - Link propagation scoring - pages inherit 80% of source page priority
  - Detailed implementation plan in
    [docs/plans/task-prioritization.md](docs/plans/_archive/task-prioritisation.md)

### Enhanced

- **Job Duplicate Prevention**: Cancel existing jobs when creating new job for
  same domain
  - Prevents multiple concurrent crawls of same domain
  - Automatically cancels in-progress jobs for domain before creating new one
  - Improves resource utilisation and prevents redundant crawling

- **Cache Warming Timing**: Adjusted delay for second cache warming attempt
  - Increased delay to 1.5x initial response time for better cache propagation

### Fixed

- **Link Discovery**: Fixed link extraction to properly find paginated links
  - Restored proper link discovery functionality that was inadvertently disabled

## [0.5.12] – 2025-06-06

### Enhanced

- **Cache Warming Timing**: Added 500ms delay between first request (cache MISS
  detection) and second request (cache verification) to allow CDNs time to
  process and cache the first response
- **Webflow Webhook Domain Selection**: Fixed webhook to use first domain
  (primary/canonical) instead of last domain (staging .webflow.io)
- **Webflow Webhook Page Limits**: Removed 100-page limit for webhook-triggered
  jobs - now unlimited for complete site cache warming

### Fixed

- **Build Error**: Removed unused `fmt` import from `internal/api/handlers.go`
  that was causing GitHub Actions build failures

## [0.5.11] – 2025-06-06

### Added

- **Webflow Webhook Integration**: Automatic cache warming triggered by Webflow
  site publishing
  - Webhook endpoint `/v1/webhooks/webflow/USER_ID` for user-specific triggers
  - Automatic job creation and execution when Webflow sites are published
  - Smart domain selection (uses first domain in array - primary/canonical
    domain)
- **Job Source Tracking**: Comprehensive tracking of job creation sources for
  debugging and analytics
  - `source_type` field: `"webflow_webhook"` or `"dashboard"`
  - `source_detail` field: Clean display text (publisher name or action type)

    details)

### Enhanced

- **Job Creation Architecture**: Refactored to eliminate code duplication
  - Extracted shared `createJobFromRequest()` function for consistent job
    creation

  columns to jobs table
- **Webhook Security**: No authentication required for webhooks (Webflow can
  POST directly)
- **Source Attribution**: Dashboard jobs tagged as `"create_job"` ready for
  future `"retry_job"` actions

## [0.5.10] – 2025-06-06

### Fixed

- **Cache Warming Data Storage**: Fixed second cache warming data not being
  stored in database
- **Timeout Retry Logic**: Added automatic retry for network timeouts and
  connection errors up to 5 attempts

## [0.5.9] – 2025-06-06

### Enhanced

- **Worker Pool Scaling**: Improved auto-scaling for better performance and bot
  protection
  - Simplified worker scaling from complex job-requirements tracking to simple
    +5/-5 arithmetic per job
  - Auto-scaling: 1 job = 5 workers, 2 jobs = 10 workers, up to maximum 50
    workers (10 jobs)
  - Each job gets dedicated workers preventing single-job monopolisation and bot
    detection risks
- **Database Connection Pool**: Increased to support higher concurrency
  - MaxOpenConns: 25 → 75 connections to prevent bottlenecks with increased
    worker count
  - MaxIdleConns: 10 → 25 connections for better connection reuse
- **Crawler Rate Limiting**: Reduced aggressive settings for better politeness
  to target servers
  - MaxConcurrency: 50 → 10 concurrent requests per crawler instance
  - RateLimit: 100 → 10 requests per second for safer cache warming

### Technical Implementation

- **Simplified Scaling Logic**: Removed complex `jobRequirements` map and
  maximum calculation logic
  - `AddJob()`: Simple `currentWorkers + 5` with max limit of 50
  - `RemoveJob()`: Simple `currentWorkers - 5` with minimum limit of 5
  - Eliminated per-job worker requirement tracking for cleaner, more predictable
    scaling

## [0.5.8] – 2025-06-03

### Added

- **Cache Warming System**: Implemented blocking cache warming with second HTTP
  requests on cache MISS/BYPASS
  - Added `second_response_time` and `second_cache_status` columns to track
    cache warming effectiveness
  - Cache warming logic integrated into crawler with automatic MISS detection
    from multiple CDN headers
  - Blocking approach ensures complete metrics collection and immediate cache
    verification
  - Supabase can calculate cache warming success (`cache_warmed`) using:
    `second_cache_status = 'HIT'`

### Fixed

- **Critical Link Extraction Bug**: Fixed context handling bug that was
  preventing all link discovery
  - Link extraction was defaulting to disabled when `find_links` context value
    wasn't properly set
  - Now defaults to enabled link extraction, fixing pagination link discovery
    (e.g., `?b84bb98f_page=2`)
  - **TODO: Verify this fix works by testing teamharvey.co/stories pagination
    links**
- **Link Extraction Logic**: Consolidated to Colly-only crawler to extract only
  user-clickable links
  - Removed overly aggressive filtering that was blocking legitimate navigation
    links
  - Now only filters empty hrefs, fragments (#), javascript:, and mailto: links
- **Dashboard Form**: Fixed max_pages input field to consistently show default
  value of 0 (unlimited)

### Enhanced

- **Code Architecture**: Eliminated logic duplication in cache warming
  implementation
  - Cache warming second request reuses main `WarmURL()` method with
    `findLinks=false`
  - Removed redundant `cache_warmed` field - can be calculated in
    Supabase/dashboard
  - Database schema includes cache warming columns in initial table creation for
    new installations

### Enhanced

- **Job Creation Modal**: Simplified interface with essential fields only
  - Removed non-functional include_paths and exclude_paths fields that aren't
    implemented in API
  - Hidden concurrency setting as job-level concurrency has no effect (system
    uses global concurrency of 50)
  - Set sensible defaults: use_sitemap=true, find_links=true, concurrency=5
  - Changed domain input from URL type to text type to allow simple domain names
    (e.g., "teamharvey.co")
- **User Experience**: Improved job creation workflow with better validation and
  feedback
  - Domain input now accepts domain names without requiring full URLs with
    protocol
